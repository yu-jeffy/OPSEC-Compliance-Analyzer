# OPSEC Compliance Analyzer

## Overview
This tool leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) and advanced vector search technologies to enhance Operational Security (OPSEC) within the military sector. It is designed to identify and mitigate potential leaks of sensitive information by comparing documents against a curated dataset of OPSEC compliant and non-compliant examples.

## Background
Traditional OPSEC measures are often manual and error-prone. This tool introduces a transformative approach, utilizing AI to streamline the review process and increase the accuracy of OPSEC compliance checks.

## Dataset
The dataset, hosted on Relevance AI, contains 123 examples derived from official Department of Defense documents and expanded using OpenAI's GPT-4. Each example is tagged with a risk level from "High" to "Low" across various categories like Operations, Plans, Communications, etc.
