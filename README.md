# OPSEC Compliance Analyzer

## Overview
This tool leverages the power of large language models (LLMs) and advanced vector search technologies to enhance Operational Security (OPSEC) within the military sector. It is designed to identify and mitigate potential leaks of sensitive information by comparing documents against a curated dataset of OPSEC compliant and non-compliant examples.

## Background
Traditional OPSEC measures are often manual and error-prone. This tool introduces a transformative approach, utilizing AI to streamline the review process and increase the accuracy of OPSEC compliance checks.

## Dataset
The dataset, hosted on Relevance AI, contains 123 examples derived from official Department of Defense documents and expanded using OpenAI's GPT-4. Each example is tagged with a risk level from "High" to "Low" across various categories like Operations, Plans, Communications, etc.

## Usage
1. Sign up or log in to [Relevance AI](https://relevanceai.com).
2. Navigate to the [OPSEC Compliance Analyzer interface](https://app.relevanceai.com](https://app.relevanceai.com/notebook/bcbe5a/94b701052be5-44a9-8b60-63766cc9cd51/5d3e49f8-44f9-4e00-90ad-7f0c057b7f59 ).
3. Paste your document into the input field.
4. Submit for analysis.
5. Review the output for potential risks and suggestions for revision.

## Example
Input and response examples are provided to illustrate the tool's capabilities in identifying potential OPSEC risks and offering corrective feedback.

## Development
This section outlines the prompt development process and the AI's training on OPSEC protocols, based on official United States Air Force guidelines.

## Analysis Workflow
